The network is built on a spine-leaf fabric across three data centers (DC1, DC2, DC3), with redundant hypervisor clusters (HV1+HV2, HV3+HV4, HV5+HV6) ensuring continuous availability, load distribution, and seamless workload migration. Security monitoring is provided by passive network-based IDS sensors attached via SPAN on each DC’s leaf aggregation switches—capturing both east-west and north-south traffic without risking inline failures—while perimeter firewalls proactively block known threats at ingress and egress points. All IDS alerts, firewall logs, and critical infrastructure events are forwarded over mutually authenticated TLS to a central SIEM cluster, where they are parsed, normalized, correlated, retained for audits, and used for automated cross-DC alerting and forensics. Within each data center, three VLAN overlays isolate traffic: a Management VLAN for hypervisor consoles (accessible only by operations hosts), a Control VLAN for internal hypervisor communications, and Tenant VLANs for VM traffic. East-west segmentation between management, control, and tenant domains is enforced by strict ACL or firewall policies following least-privilege principles. Centralized IDS rule management and optional edge encryption ensure broad visibility, high performance, and robust security across the entire topology.

Trade-offs: The overlay network adds complexity and demands robust automation and tooling. Mirror-mode IDS may miss encrypted or tunneled traffic unless decryption or proper tapping is in place. Central SIEM aggregation introduces latency and relies on reliable, TLS-encrypted log pipelines, which add processing overhead. Finally, Management and Control VLANs must be tightly locked down—any compromise here could quickly spread to other segments.
